  # This one lives in the menu bar and is therefore almost always running when an upgrade
  # arrives. Without this, brew replaces the bundle underneath the running process: the old
  # code keeps running, the menu bar keeps showing the old version, and the upgrade looks
  # like it silently did nothing.
